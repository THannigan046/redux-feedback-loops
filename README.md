# Redux Feedback Loop 


_Duration: weekend sprint

For one of our weekend challenges at prime digital academy, we were asked to create a feedback form, modeled after prime's daily reflection form, that passes data around multiple pages, saves input data, and submits it to a sql database. One of the biggest challenges of this project was figuring out how to properly design a reducer and how to access it with useSelector. Like anything else, I solved that issue by sitting down and figuring it out. I'm happy with how this project turned out. 


### Prerequisites

Create a database called 'feedback' (or whatever you want to call it) 
Run the database.sql file
Npm install 
Npm run server
Npm run client


## Usage


1. Fill out the form (go back if you want to change an answer) and click submit! You can see your answers in your sql database!
